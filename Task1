I consider my  Master's thesis as one of my greatest accomplishments. The topic I selected for my thesis is a challenging one, as it belongs to a domain(Deep learning) in which I have least experience. It was a bit hard to understandf the background and some technical terms related it it at the start, because of this I feced some issues issues whele I was working on the initial phase of my thesis, which is to prepare a thesis proposal and getting an approval from my university to move fortword. While we were working on our proposal, suddeny my group mate left me for a better oppotunity(industrial thesis). This made things ever more worst, but Instead of getting paniced I structured my day and worked on getting things right. Eventually, I managed to get a new partner and complete the propocsal in time. Then we worked on the topic and completed our thesis successfully. 

The most recent article that I studied is related to Infrastructure as a code. Here is the link- https://geekflare.com/devops-tools-ansible-and-terraform/
